Your task is to create a sample project that displays information about products i.e. online shop. An
example collection of the products to be listed, could be found here:
https://gist.github.com/Raisolution/2fa773f5b7009d4b7c487e7a0ae553c2
Using this collection is optional. You could use your own or simply display the products statically.
Technical Details
• The task is just about demonstration of the products, there is no need of implementing
extended functionality like adding products to a cart, making orders, and so on
• It is up to you to decide the styles and structure of the product list. You could improvise (e.g.
by adding images)
• Try to visually distinguish products in and out of stock
• Include a text file with short description of your project (5-10 sentences in English) – what is
the technology used in the project, what is the general purpose of it, the elements and
components it consists of, etc.
• It is up to you to choose a technology for the project between:
• jQuery
• ASP.NET MVC or Core
• or just create a simple web page using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Optional
• Create a GitHub repository containing the application
• Use Telerik components to help you build the application
• Any feedback you can provide for the quality of the Telerik documentation/demos is a bonus
for your work.
